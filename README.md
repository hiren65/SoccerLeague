Project 1 Create Soccer league teams project has 3 Steps 
1
In your Python program, read the data from the supplied CSV file. Store that data in an appropriate data type so that it can be used in the next task.
2
Create logic that can iterate through all 18 players and assign them to teams such that each team has the same number of players. The number of experienced players on each team should also be the same.
3
Finally, the program should output a text file named -- teams.txt -- that contains the league roster listing the team name, and each player on the team including the player's information: name, whether they've played soccer before and their guardians' names
